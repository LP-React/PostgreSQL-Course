Here are the things I have learned, you can use this as a roadmap if you want to learn from basic SQL up to advanced SQL with [PostgreeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). 

We will be working with TablePlus or PHPMyAdmin, and we will also need to have **Docker** installed on our system. If you have never worked with Docker before, don't worry, it's simple.

## Required Installations

  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
  - [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com)

## Prepare the enviorement

  1. Download the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.
  2. Create a folder and move the **docker-compose.yml** file there.
  3. Open the terminal and run.

      ```
      docker pull postgres:15.3
      docker pull dpage/pgadmin4
      ```

  4. Now navigate to the created folder and run `docker compose up -d`.
  5. Close the terminal, open TablePlus, and add a new connection. Fill in the fields with the following information:
      ```
      Name: learning-sql 
      Host: localhost
      Port: 5432
      User: student
      Password: 123456
      Database: course-db
      ```
      Then, click on connect.
